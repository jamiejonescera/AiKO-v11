                <p class="text-faded mb-0">John Holland's theory, often used in career assessments, suggests that people are drawn to careers that match their personality types. He categorized personalities into six types: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional (RIASEC). This theory helps individuals find careers where they can thrive based on their interests, skills, and values.</p>
